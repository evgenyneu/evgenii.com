The app shows how many litres of water are needed to produce one kilogram of different agricultural products. For example, to make one kilogram of shelled almonds one needs to use about 16 thousand litres of freshwater. The app allows to understand our indirect freshwater usage through consumption of various products. This knowledge can help us preserve scarce freshwater resources.

## Help me to localize the app

Currently the app is available in Chinese, English, Japanese and Russian languages. I would be grateful if you can help me translate the app to other languages. Translation includes the list of agricultural products (500 words), the app title, description (400 words) and a couple of words in the UI.
