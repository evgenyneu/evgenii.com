The following is a list of things each of us can do to reduce our energy consumption. It's based mostly on excellent The Great Courses lectures [The Science of Energy: Resources and Power Explained](http://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/the-science-of-energy-resources-and-power-explained.html) by Professor Michael E. Wysession.


## Consumption

* Recycle. It takes less energy to reuse materials than to make them from scratch.
* Avoid disposable items and low quality products that don’t last long.
* Purchase local food/products. Local products require less energy for transportation.
* Eat less packaged food. It takes energy to make packaging.
* Reduce amount of food you throw away. 40% of food is lost in the US during different stages from production to consumption.
* Turn off electronic devices *completely* when they are not in use instead of leaving them in standby or sleep mode. 75% of electricity from electronics is consumed when they are not on.
* Buy energy efficient house appliances (fridge, washing machine).

## Water

Heating water requires enormous amount of energy.

* Heat just enough water to fill your cup when making a hot drink. Heating extra water is wasteful.
* Use lower temperature setting in your washing machine. Your clothes will also last longer.
* Reduce time spent in the shower.

## House

* Use electricity provider that gets energy from renewable sources.
* In summer, stick reflective film to your windows. Blinds don't prevent heat from getting into your house.
* Use thermally efficient windows with vacuum between multiple glass panes.
* Generate your own energy with solar panels and store extra in batteries.
* Improve insulation of your house: windows, doors, walls.
* Plant trees around your house. Trees cool your house during summer and prevent winds from stealing away the heat in winter.

## Lights

* Use natural light whenever possible.
* Turn off the lights when you leave the room.
* Use LED light bulbs.
* Install lighting dimmers.
* Install solar powered street lights that point down.
* Install motion sensors that turn lights off in offices and other public places.

## Cooling/heating

* Use heat pump technology for both heating and cooling instead of electrical/gas heating.
* Set thermostat to lower temperature in winter and higher temperature in summer.
* Consider putting on warmer clothes instead of cooling/heating the whole room.
* Keep doors/windows shut when cooling/heating is on.
* Change air filters of cooling/heating equipment regularly.



## Transportation

* Reduce amount of flying.
* Work remotely and teleconference for meetings instead of commuting.
* Bicycle whenever possible.
* Use public transportation. Electric public transport is most efficient.
* Transport goods by water or train instead of truck/air.

## Driving

* Use electric car.
* Use smaller/lighter car.
* Reduce unnecessary acceleration and braking.
* Avoid driving alone. Having more passengers is more efficient.
* Keep your car tuned up: replace air filters, keep tires fully inflated etc.


## I did not know that…

* Flying in an airplane is one of the most energy intensive thing we do. Boeing 747 consumes 140 megawatts, which is equal to the energy consumed by a hundred thousand (100 000) US homes. During a 12-hour flight you will consume as much energy one US household consumes over one year (in electricity).
* The total distance humans drive in two years is about the same as the distance to the nearest star, Proxima Centauri.
* Electric cars are four to six times more efficient than gas-powered cars.
* Bicycling is one of the most energy efficient ways of traveling.
* Energy efficiency of walking depends on the food you eat. For example, beef requires a lot of energy to produce (to feed the cows). If you eat a lot of beef then walking is as energy inefficient as driving alone in the car.

## Ideas for the future

* Install electricity meter that displays the cost of your current energy use in the center of your house where everyone can see it.
* Using virtual reality equipment for teleconferencing can make business meeting more realistic and can make commute/flying unnecessary.
* Show the cost of current fuel consumption in your car.
* Design new homes with energy savings in mind: insulation, air flow, orientation, tilt of windows, solar panels on rooftops.


## Why should I save energy in the first place?

* It reduces pollution.
* It reduces greenhouse gas emission.
* It reduces human impact on ecosystems, maintains biodiversity and prevents extinction of species.
* It leaves the planet in better condition for future generations.
* It saves you money.
