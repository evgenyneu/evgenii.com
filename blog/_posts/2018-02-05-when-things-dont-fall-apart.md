In his book [Enlightenment Now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_Now) Steven Pinker makes a point that I found interesting and brilliantly obvious.

When we see a poor person or some other bad stuff happening, we sometimes tend to blame something or someone for that. We blame this person, government, God, Jews, Muslims, corporations, immigrants, socialists, gays, guns, video games, drugs etc. It is probably a natural tendency of our brains to search for patterns and causes even when there arenâ€™t any.

But in most cases the explanation for bad stuff is just bad luck. Or in other words, it is the 2nd law of thermodynamics. It is all about probability.

There are infinitely more ways for bad things to happen than for good things. In other words, a probability of a bad outcome is much larger than of a good one.

From this perspective, there is no cause of poverty. Or rather, there is no simple or single cause of poverty. Instead, there are infinitely many interacting factors that are much more likely to result in poverty than in prosperity. Poverty is just a natural state of equilibrium, because things normally fall apart.

What is surprising is when things don't fall apart. What is remarkable is that we sometimes see good stuff: prosperity, decline in violence and mortality, increase in health, income, human rights, animal rights etc.

And if we go out and look around we may find many good things happening *right now*.
